## Code Structure and Technical Implementation

### Frontend Code (`main.py`)
- **Description:** Sets up the Streamlit interface for the app.
- **Key Components:**
  - `st.title`: Defines the application title.
  - **Language Selection Dropdowns:** Uses `st.selectbox` for selecting input and output languages.
  - **Translation Button and Output Display:** `st.button("Translate")` triggers the translation function, with the output displayed using `st.success`.
- **Outcome:** Provides a clean, responsive user interface that is easy to navigate and interact with.

### Backend Code (`translator_utils.py`)
- **Description:** Manages the translation logic by integrating OpenAI’s GPT-4o API with LangChain.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Configuration and API Setup:** Configures the OpenAI API key from a JSON config file.
  - **Prompt Creation and LangChain Pipeline:** Utilizes `ChatPromptTemplate` to structure the translation prompt, specifying source and target languages and user input.
  - **Translation Function:** The `translate` function invokes the LangChain pipeline to process the prompt and return translated content.
- **Outcome:** Allows smooth integration of the GPT-4o API with structured prompts, ensuring reliable and high-quality translations across languages.
